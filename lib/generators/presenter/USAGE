    Description:
  Creates a boilerplate file for a new Presenter Object. Pass it a name,
  either CamelCase or snake_case. Optional: a list of methods as arguments.
  To create a Presenter object within a module, pass it as either `--module NAME`
  or `--module=NAME`.
  The file lives, by community-convention, in `app/presenters`, or in
  `app/presenters/{module}` if module is present.

Example:
  `rails generate presenter Modal heading body button`

  This will create:
    app/presenters/modal_presenter.rb
