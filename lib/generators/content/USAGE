    Description:
  Scaffold an entire content resource (eg. blog, articles, knowledge base, etc.)
  with an author, tags and markdown. Adds models, migrations, controllers, views and Css.

Usage:
  Pass the name of the model, either CamelCase or snake_case as the first argument
  along with an optional list of attributes (title, body, slug come by default).
  All default controller actions are created, where `new`, `create`, `edit`,
  `update` and `destroy` are only accessible to an User with `admin` set to true.

  Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
  model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
  specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

Examples:
  `rails generate content Post`

    Will create a scaffold with all default controller CRUD actions,
    tags (`Post has_many :tags`), an author (`Post belongs_to :author,
    class_name: 'User'`), markdown (for the body) and views with Css added.

  `rails generate content Post --skip-tags`

    Will create a scaffold with all default controller CRUD actions,
    without added tags.

  `rails generate content Post --skip-author`

    Will create a scaffold with all default controller CRUD actions,
    without an author.

  `rails generate content Post --skip-markdown`

    Will create a scaffold with all default controller CRUD actions,
    without an markdown (using kramdown) added.
