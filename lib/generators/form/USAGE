    Description:
  Creates a boilerplate file for a new Form Object. Pass it a name,
  either CamelCase or snake_case. Optional: a list of methods as arguments.
  To create a Form object within a module, pass it as either `--module NAME`
  or `--module=NAME`.
  The file lives, by community-convention, in `app/forms`, or in
  `app/forms/{module}` if module is present.

Example:
  `rails generate form Signup name email team_name`

  This will create:
    app/forms/signup_form.rb (with the `name`, `email` and team_name as string attributes)
